# Home Appliances Controlled by Human Voice
Remote control of household devices has long been explored in various ways. From electronic remote control using infrared sensor to voice controlled application, 
we are continually trying to find a better way to control electrical and electronic devices to ease our daily life. This model presents the development of low-cost 
remote home control system using an Arduino, a mobile device with some relay modules and a HC05 Bluetooth module. The system focused on controlling fan, lamp and other 
electrical appliances. The voice command is a serial input sent to the Arduino through a mobile application. The software will convert the voice into a string that the 
microcontroller will process, then send the specific signals to the various relays and peripherals. The system will also include a basic level of security where it 
requires a specific string before it allows any commands to go through.
